**Abcvfx** is a Unity package that allows using an Alembic animation as a VFX
source.

#### MeshBaker

**MeshBaker** converts an animating mesh into an animating point cloud. It not
only bakes vertex positions and normals but also vertex colors from a given
texture.

It also supports HAP video textures, which is useful for converting a
volumetric video.

You can bind a baked point cloud to a VFX component using
**VFXBakedMeshBinder**.
